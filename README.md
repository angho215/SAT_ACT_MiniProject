# Project 1: 2017 - 2018 SAT and ACT Analysis

## Summary

We will use the following techquies to analysis on given datasets:

- basic statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- many Python programming concepts
- programmatically interacting with files and directories
- visualizations
- EDA
- working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

## Problem 
- How to increase the test participation rate?
- Investigate the relationship between participation rate and all variables in the dataset
- ANY interesting findings?

## Datasets
- 2017 SAT
- 2017 ACT
- 2018 SAT
- 2018 ACT

## Presentation

### State
Pennsylvinia

### Finding
Although the correlation between Total score vs SAT participation has strong negative relationship, the dataset also indication the higher score in ACT composite will also have a higher SAT participation which I donâ€™t think that will be the case unless the students took both tests. But Penn has low participation rate in ACT, so I think the College board should first increase the incentive of taking SAT in order to increase the rate of participation.

### Recommadation
- Partner with high school to structure out after-school SAT prep training course
- Discount/fee waver/Scholarship for low-income households
